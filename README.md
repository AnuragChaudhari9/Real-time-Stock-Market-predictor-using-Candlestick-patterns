## Real-time-Stock-Market-predictor-using-Candlestick-patterns

This code obtains real time Stock Market data from Alpha Vantage API and detects two of my favorite Candlestick Patterns: Doji and Tweezer
**Doji Pattern:** A Doji candlestick pattern occurs when the opening and closing prices of an asset are nearly equal, resulting in a very small body that appears as a thin horizontal line. This pattern suggests indecision or a balance between buyers and sellers in the market, often signaling a potential reversal or continuation depending on its context and the preceding price action. Traders interpret the Doji as a potential reversal signal when it is followed by a pattern with same trend colour. As in, a Green candlestick after a Bullish Doji might hint at stock rising. Whereas, a Bearish Doji followed by Red candlestick indicates potential fall in stock value.
**Tweezer:** A Tweezer pattern in candlestick charting consists of two consecutive candlesticks with almost identical highs and lows, appearing side by side. This pattern typically signals a potential reversal of the prevailing trend when it forms at key support or resistance levels.
